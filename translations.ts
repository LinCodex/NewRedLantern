        amanda: "Been coming here for almost 10 years! Best kept secret in Babylon! Very nice and accommodating staff. You can't find this great quality of a massage anywhere else for the price! Awesome spot and highly recommend.",
        paul: "I went here for the first time, and I have to say that in the last 10 years of getting massages regularly, I got THE BEST massage of my life! Sofie hit every knot, nerve, and tight muscule i had and worked them till they were gone. She then proceeded to walk on my back and with skill and precision she worked even deeper into my muscules!! This is not your typical average massage place, these employees are very skilled!! I walked out of there feeling lighter and looser than ive been in a decade!! I will 100% become a regular customer here!!! Thank You so much.",
        christine: "Can't say one bad thing. I loved my massage the price was great. Very clean. Very friendly. My masseuse made sure I was comfortable and checked in on the pressure during the massage! I will be back.",
        tony: "Did an hour massage with my GF and honestly we got a great massage for an amazing price. Can't wait to go back! It was full body massage and even involved hot stones at one point. Highly recommend!",
